# Android-Practice-Apps
This repository contains the android projects that I developed as a beginner.

## Nature of Projects
There are certain building blocks of android development that every developer must know. This is a documentation of my process of learning to implement those building blocks.

1. [Convert Kilometers to Miles and vice versa](ConvertMilesToKm/ConvertMilesToKm)
- This is an example of an app that takes input from the user via a widget and processes it.

2. [Percentage Calculator](percentage_calculator)
This is an example of an app that:
- features SMS sending
- has multiple activities that the user can navigate through
- asks for permission to send SMS from the user once the app in installed
