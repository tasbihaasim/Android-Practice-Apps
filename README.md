## Android-Practice-Apps
This repository contains the android projects that I developed as a beginner.

## Nature of Projects
There are certain building blocks of android development that every developer must know. This is a documentation of my process of learning to implement those building blocks. The building blocks of respective apps are mentioned in bullet points below.


1. [Medical](Medical): (WIP) The application enables doctors to maintain a database by entering information of every single patient that visits him/her. The app makes use of [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). 

- Writing data on Firebase database
- Reading data from Firebase database
- click [here](Medical.pdf) to see what the app looks like.

2. [Percentage Calculator](percentage_calculator): It is a simple app that takes input in form of students' grades, calculates percentage and final grades and then allows the user (a teacher) to send result to parents. Building blocks used:

- SMS sending
- Multiple activities that the user can navigate through
- Asks for permission to send SMS from the user once the app in installed 
- click [here](percentage_calculator-converted.pdf) to see what this app looks like.

3. [RedGreenBlue](RedGreenBlue): The app loads an image and allows the user to change the colors of the image using a seekbar. This happens because RGB values of the image are being changedd in the backend. The building blocks of the app are:

- Seekbar
- Use of ImageView
- Change in RGB value of the Image
- Making use of Resource directory
- click [here](RedGreenBlue.pdf) to see what this app looks like.

4. [KnowYourDS](KnowYourDS): This is a simple application that makes use of WebView and displays and Webpage. The building blocks of the app are:

- WebView
- Including HTML file in the resources
